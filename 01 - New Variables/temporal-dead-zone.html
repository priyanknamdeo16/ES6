  // let and const have two broad differences from var:

  //1. They are block scoped.
  //2. Accessing a var before it is declared has the result undefined; accessing a let or const before it is declared throws ReferenceError

  //It appears from above example that let declarations (and const, which works the same way) may not be hoisted, since mylet does not appear to exist before it is assigned a value.
  //That is not the case, however, let and const are hoisted (like var, class and function), but there is a period between entering scope and being declared where they cannot be accessed. 
  //This period is the temporal dead zone (TDZ).

  //The TDZ ends when mylet is declared, rather than assigned


  let x = 'outer value';
  (function() {
    // start TDZ for x
    console.log(x); //Uncaught ReferenceError: x is not defined
    let x = 'inner value'; // declaration ends TDZ for x
  }());

  //Accessing x in the inner scope still causes a ReferenceError. If let were not hoisted, it would log outer value
